                  Always prepared, both in the air and on the ground, members
                  of the Civil Air Patrol perform emergency services for state
                  and local agencies as well as the federal government as the
                  civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force and for states/local
                  communities as a nonprofit organization. Ever vigilant, these
                  true patriots make a difference in their communities, not only
                  to assist in times of disaster but also to search for the
                  lost and protect the homeland.

                  Civil Air Patrol’s cadet program transforms youth into dynamic
                  Americans and aerospace leaders through a curriculum that
                  focuses on leadership, aerospace, fitness and character. As
                  cadets participate in these four elements, they advance through
                  a series of achievements, earning honors and increased
                  responsibilities along the way. Many of the nation’s astronauts,
                  pilots, engineers and scientists first explored their
                  careers through CAP.
